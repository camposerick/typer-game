# Typer Game

Typer is a typing game where you can practice your typing skills. I built this project to practice features I studied recently such as HTML, Javascript, Jquery and Bootstrap.

### The challenge

Create a project which gives you a random text to type and save your historical results in a scoreboard.

## Process

I started looking for an API that gives random quotes. I found Quotable API. Then I started to code GET request with Axios and added some Bootstrap classes for the design. After that I wrote the JS algorithms to check if the input text is equal to the quote and then the Scoreboard and localStorage methods. At the end I added the click events and fixed some bugs.

### Features

- Semantic HTML
